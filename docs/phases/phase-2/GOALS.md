## Goals

### Primary Goal
Make every user journey (artisan, customer, admin) complete from start to finish. No dead ends, no stub pages, no broken flows.

### Demo Goals (What to show mam)
1. **Complete Artisan Journey** -- Register, build profile, list services, set availability, receive and manage bookings, get paid, see earnings
2. **Complete Customer Journey** -- Search, discover, book, pay, chat with artisan, video call, leave review
3. **Working Payment Flow** -- Full payment cycle including refunds and transaction history
4. **Real-time Communication** -- Chat auto-creates on booking, video scheduling works
5. **Admin Oversight** -- Admin can see and manage everything happening on the platform
