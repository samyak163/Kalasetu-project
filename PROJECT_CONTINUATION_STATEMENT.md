## HOW TO ADD THIS TO YOUR SYNOPSIS:

### Option 1: Add as a highlighted box (Recommended)

In your Word document, after the "Need for KalaSetu" section (page 4-5), insert this:

1. Insert a text box (Insert → Text Box → Simple Text Box)
2. Copy the content above (the boxed section starting with 📋)
3. Format the box:
   - Border: 2pt, Blue (#4A90E2)
   - Background: Light blue (#E3F2FD)
   - Shading: 10%
4. This makes it visually stand out

### Option 2: Add as a regular section

Simply add as a new subsection:

```
### Project Continuation Statement

**Project Status:** Continuing from previous semester (Version 1.0 → Version 2.0)

[Then paste the content]
```

### Option 3: Add to Section 2.2 (Objectives)

Add a subsection called "Project Continuation and New Modules" right at the beginning of Section 2.2.

---

## ALTERNATIVELY: Update Section 1.1 Title

Change the title from:

```
### Version 1.0 Summary (Previous Semester)
```

To:

```
### 📌 PROJECT CONTINUATION: Version 1.0 → Version 2.0

**Previous Semester (Version 1.0 - Completed):**
[existing content]

**This Semester (Version 2.0 - Enhancement):**
[existing content]
```

This makes it immediately obvious you're continuing.

---

## WHAT MAKES THIS CLEAR:

✅ Explicitly states "CONTINUING from Previous Semester"
✅ Shows Version 1.0 (done) vs Version 2.0 (in progress)
✅ Lists EXACTLY what was built before
✅ Lists EXACTLY what NEW modules/features are being added
✅ Uses "NEW" markers for completely new features
✅ Uses "Enhanced" markers for improved existing features
✅ Groups new work into logical modules
✅ Shows before/after comparison

## MY RECOMMENDATION:

**You don't NEED to add this** - your current synopsis DOES explain project continuation (Section 1.1 "Version 1.0 Summary" and Section 1.2 "Enhanced Scope").

**BUT if you want to be 100% CRYSTAL CLEAR**, add the highlighted box in Option 1 - it will:
- Catch faculty's attention immediately
- Show you understand the instruction
- Make grading easier for them
- Look professional

Your call! The current synopsis is already compliant with the instruction. This is just an optional "extra clear" version.
