I need help fixing an issue in my codebase. Here's the context:

## Project
[Brief description of your project - e.g., "KalaSetu - Artisan marketplace platform"]

## Problem Description
@[path/to/issue-document.md]

[OR write directly:]
- **What's broken**: [Describe what's not working]
- **Expected behavior**: [What should happen]
- **Current behavior**: [What actually happens]
- **Error messages**: [Any console errors, if you have them]

## Related Files
[If you know which files might be involved, mention them:]
- `path/to/file1.js`
- `path/to/file2.jsx`
- `path/to/file3.md`

## What I Need
1. Investigate the actual root cause (don't assume the problem description is correct)
2. Fix all related issues you find
3. Test the fix to verify it works
4. Update the markdown file with:
   - What the actual problem was
   - What you fixed
   - Test results with screenshots
5. Create a walkthrough.md documenting the entire investigation and solution

## Additional Context
- Backend running at: http://localhost:5000
- Frontend running at: http://localhost:5173
- [Any other important info]

## Test Credentials (if needed)
- User: user@test.com / Test@123456
- Artisan: artisan@test.com / Test@123456
- Admin: admin@kalasetu.com / Admin@123456

Please investigate thoroughly, don't trust assumptions, and test everything!

🎁 Pro Tips for Next Session:
Always reference the .md file with @[path/to/file.md] - this gives me full context
Say "investigate thoroughly" - this tells me not to trust the initial diagnosis
Ask me to test and verify - I'll actually run the code and check if it works
Mention if servers are running - saves time
Include test credentials - so I can actually login and test

The backend and frontend are already running from the previous session.

Fix this problem:
- Use Option A from the markdown
- Tell me what you need me to do
- Test it thoroughly and verify all success criteria
- Check if there are other related issues and fix them too

@[antigravity/02-FIX-bookings-page-stub.md]

Fix this bookings page issue:
1. Investigate what's actually wrong (don't assume it's what the markdown says)
2. Fix all related bugs you discover
3. Test thoroughly with the existing test user (user@test.com / Test@123456)
4. Verify all success criteria
5. Update the markdown and create walkthrough
